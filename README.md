# ocvGraph (V1.3.0)
Implementation of class for graph plotting in C++ through OpenCV 3.

Features:
+Set arbitrary range on X & Y axes
+Plot circles, lines(in Cartesian or polar), polynomials of any degree
+Plot in different colors
+Append legend describing which line represents which function

Current implementation developed and tested under OpenCV 3.2.0

For compiling sources in /examples from Linux terminal you can use the command below while in folder /examples:

`` g++ -std=c++11  main.cpp ../ocvgraph.cpp -o main `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv-3.2.0-dev` ``

NOTE: Replace 'opencv-3.2.0-dev' with your version of OpenCV.
